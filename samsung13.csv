samsung13,Sutosom Ghosh,5,Brilliant,Average phone for a budget price. Good enough for a mom and dad who aren't that swift with smartphones. 4GB RAM is a plus as other brands offer 2GB RAM at this price. It's going to help in the long run, both RAM and ROM.Processor is not powerful. And it is expected for this price. It gets the job done. It's a 4G phone. And network reception is very good. Camera is below average. So does the speaker.  Sounds tinny. Design of the phone looks beautiful. But you could hear creaking sound he...

samsung13,Datla Srinivasa Raju,3,Does the job,Purchased GOAT Green on 1st day sale. Battery charging speed with Samsung 25w C to C Adopter is good and enough and lasts around 40 hrs of normal use.

With Bluetooth audio, screen mirroring issues, battery backup not like 6000 mah.Chinese phones delivering far better user experience.Samsung's smart things app is not smart.
samsung13,Sumith Ramdas,5,Terrific purchase,Overall a very good phone in the budget. The best thing is Samsung's One UI core. The best UI I have ever used. Can easily recommend if you are not a gamer.

samsung13,Keyur Purohit,1,Worst experience ever!,Over all good phoneBut the Camera quality in a low light is not that good.Overall display colour contrast is decent.Battery performance is good you can rock with 60% charge overall day.Basel is so thick in comparison of the other phone in to this price range.Phone is slightly heavy in weight.Its come with samsung ui 5.0 and Android 13 and Exynos support so no problem in the daily use.
