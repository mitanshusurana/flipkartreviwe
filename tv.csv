tv,‚Çπ13,490,5,Wonderful,Nice tv within the budget. Sound quality is good, for picture quality I had to attach hdmi cable from set top box to tv. After that quality is pretty good.This tv did not come with a stand so I had only one option with the wall mount which I didn't like. Apart from that overall experience is good.

tv,‚Çπ13,490,4,Worth the money,Go for it Nice 32 inch tv by our old trusted brand SamsungSamsung make TV's from CRT edition to now QLEDAnd then Samsung service any where by their experts was goodOn last I want to say if any one want to buy tv remember this points:*Go for a trusted brand who gave good after sale service  because this was a tv not a mobile which we donot change after 2 or 3 years.*Check ratings from inside like picture, sound, connectivity.*Check online reviews ,video etc
tv,‚Çπ13,490,5,Fabulous!,After watching 3-4 days on this led tv.. I found it good worth of money.. Picture quality is awesome and clear.. Sound is good and not need to connect any other speaker because the output of the TV speakers is enough to enjoy a loud sound experience. Connectivity options are good and quick.. Overall I will recommended it to buy  over Mi, realme and other similar brands..
tv,‚Çπ13,490,2,Moderate,Not so good. Didn‚Äôt expect this kind of product from a popular brand like Samsung. Disappointing and the functionality is completely a old way. All the popular apps like Hotstar, aha, etc., are not downloadable as it is not allowing and we need to switch off and switch on the tv every-time to install an app but those apps will not work. Need to fix lot of bugs in the software.

(5/5)Got 3 years full warranty due to Independence day promotional offer, which was pretty good add-on. :)Now, coming back to TV - 43UQ7500PSF..Picture: Picture quality is very good.

tv,‚Çπ30,490,4,Nice product,Colour production is good , motion interpolation is perfect . It is va panel for 43 inch tv viewing angle is good, not ips as  in description , sound quality is good, Contrast ratio is actually ok  and at times black looks like grey .
tv,‚Çπ30,490,5,Awesome,Bought in Big Billion Sale and got the tv within 7 days. Good delivery by flipkart on those busy days. Coming to LG TV, we were using LG 32 inch tv for last 5 yrs and this was an upgrade. TV is quite nice. WebOS is functional. Easy to use. This does not have a magic remote but I don't think we need that as it have LG thinq app which does it better than remote. Video quality is great as expected. Sound quality is more than what we expected. It's ability to pair with Bluetooth speakers and t...
tv,‚Çπ30,490,2,Not good,There is difference in opinion about its panel type. Whether it is VA or IPS? LG has not yet revealed about panel type. Viewing angle is not like 178 deg. Magic remote has not been provided thats why we cannot use Alexa and Google voice assistant. You have to purchase magic remote. We can give voice commands through  LG thinq app downloaded in your smart phone but voice recognition is very poor. Compatible magic remote for TV model is not available in India. Be carefull while purchasing remot...
tv,‚Çπ30,490,5,Classy product,Using it for over 7 days. It has amazing picture quality, sound is good thanks to AI mode, low boot up time, connectivity with Bluetooth and WiFi works great, supports all famous OTT apps and best part is it‚Äôs support to IPhone. Just go for it! Thanks to flipkart for delivery in one day and installation done on same day.
tv,‚Çπ30,490,4,Wonderful,I have looked for various brands and researched extensively before buying this tv. In short, for people looking for other options, this lg tv beats all other brands like hisense, mi, sansui, kodak, vu, blaunkpunkt, motorola, nokia, thomson etc. I have seen some of the tvs above mentioned by naked eye and no one comes close to this. Other brands boast of extensive features, but as they say they are all "jack of all trades, but master of none". Trust me, hdr on this tv is better than dolby visi...

tv,‚Çπ30,490,4,Good choice,Pros:- 1. Best value for money if u cannot offer Sony u can blindly go for this.2. Almost equal to natural colurs where as in Samsung it is warm colur.3. Good contrast ratio less then Samsung but still not too worst. 4. Sound is superb for a medium size room.Cons:-1. The panel used is not IPS, compromised viewing angle.2. Without magic remote TV is dumb or kindly install LG application where u can use same magic remote.Overall installation and delivery experience was good
tv,‚Çπ30,490,4,Delightful,Nice Smart TV must purchase. It's my first smart TV and I checked each & everything working fine as of now. Screencast working smoothly. You can make your smartphone your magic remote for this Smart TV. Overall I liked it and thanks to LG for keeping the trust.

tv,‚Çπ92,990,5,Terrific purchase,Superb tv .. Stunning to watch movies,series in 4K.Suggest to have Home theatre for complete cinema experience.. well tv speaker quality also good if have a small living / bedroom.
tv,‚Çπ92,990,4,Good quality product,The tv was delivered to me within 2 days but the installation didn't happen for 5 days and i had to call flipkart and Samsung several times for the installation and then it happened, so i am really disappointed at that front. As for the tv, i found it ok, i was expecting a quality lile oled but that's my fault otherwise pics and videos are good vibrant but i highly suggest you invest in a decent soundbar.Also the offer included a free magnetic bezel worth 9900/- but flipkart is very very re...
tv,‚Çπ92,990,5,Fabulous!,It's really amazing choice...Thanks to samsung. I choose installation with samsung by help of customer care and it worked superb for me. This tv features are really amazing..the multi view, pc mode, ambient and art mode....many many more. If you have a proper hd content to watch..one of the best screens with 120 hz refresh.
tv,‚Çπ92,990,5,Simply awesome,Looks stunning in your living room. Art mode is a great feature. Very good display.. colors are really pop out and looks amazing. Intelligent mode works quite well. 40 watt sound is good enough. Tizen OS is very smooth and all the apps work well. Looks really great on the wall..Internal storage is 6 GB and it's enough..
tv,‚Çπ92,990,4,Wonderful,TV is fairly nice. The 43 inch is a bit different from other sizes in few aspects. The major one being, you wont get the no gap wall mount. Instead there are 2 very small and sleek wall mounts. That made the whole installation process a big hassle. The Jeeves executive was also surprised to see that wall mount and it took him approx. 30-45 min. to mount the TV. However, once installed, TV looks flushed inside the wall. But still, Samsung could have provided a no gap wall mount with smaller si...
tv,‚Çπ92,990,5,Wonderful,Best Tv ever. I really liked the frame concept and the picture quality. Sound is average. Tizen Os is really fast and easy to use. It looks really beautiful on the wall. I didn‚Äôt really like the way the installation was done by the technician. I am giving 5 stars just because i really liked the Tv.
tv,‚Çπ92,990,5,The best 43 inch QLED in the market,Amazing TV!Pros:- Display quality is awesome.- Good upscaling of SD channels compared to other brands.- Good brightness levels with no noticeable glare.- Interface is very responsive. No lag- Super thin display with an additional One Connect BoxCons:- Average sound quality with low volume levels- No support for Jio TV and very few apps available compared to an Android TVNote: Remote reception is on One Connect Box. So if you keep the box inside the cupboard or somewhere far, it w...
tv,‚Çπ92,990,5,Super!,Samsung frame 55 inch - Overall a good buy.Pros : 120hz refresh rate, QLED color contrast is better than normal LED. I really love the way TV is transformed to a neatly wall mounted frame. All connectivity is neatly separated to one connect box and just one thin wire which connects to TV. Solar charged remote is a good idea considering the amount of power it needs. Samsung thought process seems to be on how to avoid mess on every single aspect. If you are looking for something new go for it.
tv,‚Çπ92,990,5,Perfect product!,The Bazel frame given with the TV is not as expected one.Very thin Bazel frame and it doesn't add the aesthetic look of TV.It's required some more width, especially for 55 inch.Picture quality is good as expected from a QLED.One connect is a beautiful concept.Voice control,solar recharge and universal control is a good features in beautiful Samsung remote.There is a lag in remote controlerUpdates1.

‚Çπ13,490,Vamsi Krishna Nittala,2,Moderate,Not so good. Didn‚Äôt expect this kind of product from a popular brand like Samsung. Disappointing and the functionality is completely a old way. All the popular apps like Hotstar, aha, etc., are not downloadable as it is not allowing and we need to switch off and switch on the tv every-time to install an app but those apps will not work. Need to fix lot of bugs in the software.

‚Çπ41,999,Mahesh,4,Good quality product,Pros:1. Picture quality is perfect(I think it is better than its competitors at this price range)2. 4k videos can play perfectly fine.3. Bezels are thin.(for people who don't like thick bezels it's a perfect tv).4. Patchwall looks goodCons:1. The biggest con of this tv is SPEAKERS. I have got 43" tv which has 30 w speakers (believe me my old CRT tv can produce better sound than this). I think all those Dolby Atmos and stuff are gimmicks. If sound is ur mail priority don't go for this t...
